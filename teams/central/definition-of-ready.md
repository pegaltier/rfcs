# Definition of Ready (target)
Backlog items are intended to capture any and all targets that would bring value to the business.

It should be clear **who** would benefit from this work, **what** the end result would achieve, and **why** it has value; typically written in the format "As a [who], I [what], so that [why]".

- the **Who**, should identify the persona who will use the result of this work
- the **What**, should identify what the [who] expects to be changed if this work is completed.
- the **Why**, should identify what "pain point" will be relieved if this work is completed.

### Quick checklist

- [ ] **Valuable -** do all the stakeholders understand this item's value?
- [ ] **Scope -** can this backlog item be completed in less than a quarter of the sprint?
- [ ] **Testable -** can each acceptance criteria be checked by the PO without assistance from the developers?
- [ ] **Independent -** this backlog item is not currently blocked by another item?
- [ ] **Flexible -** this backlog item does not specify implementation details?

## Acceptance criteria
Acceptance criteria should help communicate scope and success.  Each criterion should define boundaries by describing intention, not by defining solutions.

### Tips
- should be written before implentation is planned
- should include what is not acceptable
- should follow rule-oriented or scenario-oriented formats
- should clearly describe pass/fail result

## Spike
Spikes are for choosing and planning how work will be implemented.  They provide oportunity for the developers to share knowledge and gain concensus before developerment begins.

#### Successful
The result of a successful Spike should be in the form of an RFC.

#### Unsuccesful
The result of an unsuccessful Spike should make the research and discoveries transparent; the result should explain why there is no possible solution.
