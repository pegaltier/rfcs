# Working Agreement (process)

#### Codeowners
Indicate who is responsible for a codebase and they have final say on issues/PRs in their scope of
responsibility

#### Branch protections/rules
Are there to ensure that codeowners can follow what is happening in their scope of responsibility

#### Concensus
Is necessary to ensure that codeowners are ready to support a set of changes

#### Release
Signifies a working state that all codeowners approve and are willing to support

#### Pull Requests
Are used to bring transparency to the changing codebase.  A PR should not be updated directly by
anyone other than the original author.  To propose changes in an existing PR, create a separate PR
that merges into the target PR.


***Code formatting***
- javascript - `prettier`
- rust - `cargo fmt`
- nix - [nixpkgs-fmt](https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-fmt)

***Team members agree to***
- keep tasks updated daily
- attend stand-up; for no longer than 15 min
- attend backlog refinement; for no longer than 10% of sprint effort
- ignore; or notify PO; of any external requests
- not compromise on quality to reach deadlines, including:
  - NOT merging PRs
  - NOT skipping issues
  - NOT releasing code we are unwilling to support
  - NOT ignoring this working agreement
  - NOT developing before designing

> An example of an acceptable scenario to compromise on quality would be when developing a
> proof-of-concept.  Something that is not expected to have LTS (long-term support).
